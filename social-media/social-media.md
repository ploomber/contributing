# Social media


If you've worked on a new feature, bug fix, demo, etc. We encourage you to post your
work on social media.

We use [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) to schedule social media posts, ask Eduardo
for credentials.

## Guidelines

- If you're building a demo or blog post, you can schedule it as soon as it has been published
- If it's a new feature or bug fix in an open-source project, ensure it has been published on PyPI already by looking at the `CHANGELOG.md`
- Ensure you include nice visuals with the post (images, screenshots, screen recordings)
- Space out publications among weekdays, if weekdays are full, it's ok to post on weekends
- Each post should be scheduled on LinkedIn and X (Twitter)
